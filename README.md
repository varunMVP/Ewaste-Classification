📦 E-Waste Generation Classification

This project builds a machine learning classification model to identify regions with high or low e-waste generation, helping inform policy-making and environmental management.

🚀 Project Goals

Analyze an e-waste dataset and preprocess it for machine learning.

Train classification models (Decision Tree, Random Forest) on e-waste generation data.

Evaluate model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.

Provide insights to stakeholders for better e-waste management.

📚 Learning Objectives

Apply data cleaning and feature selection techniques.

Use supervised machine learning for classification problems.

Interpret performance metrics on real-world environmental data.

Highlight the importance of data science in addressing e-waste challenges.
